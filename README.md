🚗 Traffic Accident Analysis using Power BI 🚦

I recently worked on an in-depth Traffic Accident Report using Power BI, where I analyzed accident trends based on multiple factors such as time, weather, road conditions, and accident severity. This project provides valuable insights into accident patterns to enhance road safety.

🔍 Key Insights & Features:

1️⃣ Analyzed 17,655 accidents using structured data and visualized trends effectively.
2️⃣ Time-Based Analysis: Identified peak accident hours and categorized accidents based on day/night visibility.
3️⃣ Severity Trends: Examined accident impact, including fatalities and non-fatal injuries.
4️⃣ Weather & Road Conditions: Assessed accident rates under different weather and road surface conditions.
5️⃣ Accident Type Analysis: Categorized accidents by type (e.g., Head-on, Sideswipe, Pedestrian, Fixed Object).
6️⃣ Traffic Control Impact: Analyzed accident frequency under different traffic control measures (e.g., stop signs, traffic signals).
7️⃣ Financial Impact: Estimated damage severity with categories ranging from minor damages (<$500) to major damages (>$1,500).
8️⃣ Interactive Power BI Dashboard: Built a dynamic report for better visualization and decision-making.
